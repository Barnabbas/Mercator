/**
 * CommandView is a ViewComponent that allows text-based game behaviour.
 * CommandView uses commands to manage what it can use and what it can't use.<br>
 * It communicates with a Controller. The Controller has to support the following functionality:
 * It must handle commands send: those are the Commands that the user has entered.
 * It must send the current description of the situation and the new collection of commands.
 * It must send an Open message to allow this View again for listening to Commands.
